### Jenkins:

Jenkins is an open-source automation tool written in Java with plugins built for Continuous Integration and Continuous deployment/delivery purposes.

### Why Jenkins:

jenkins is used to build and test your software projects continuously make it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and make it easier for users to obtain a fresh build. It provides many plugins that help to support building, deploying and automating any project.

### Continuous Integration:

Continuous Integration is a software development practice `where code is continuously tested after a commit to ensure there are no bugs`. The common practice is that whenever a code commit occurs, a build should be triggered.

### Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment is a software development process where code changes to an` application are released automatically into the production environment.`

### Continuous Delivery

Continuous delivery is a software development practice where a code change is built, tested, and then` pushed to a non-production` testing or staging environment but final deploy to production is made after approval.

### Advantages of Jenkins
 * Open source tool
 * Easy to install
 * Platform Independent
 * Support 1000+ plugins
 * Free of cost
 * Automates integration
  
### Webhook

Webhook in jenkins triggers pipeline automatically when any changes are done in github repo like commit and push.

 * Copy jenkins URL
 * Go to repo settings in github
 * Select Add webhook and paste URL
 * Append url with /github-webhook/
  
### Monitoring in Jenkins

* Install any monitoring plugins like Prometheus, grafana, datadog ...
* SSH into prometheus server
* Edit vi /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml file
* Add jenkins target - ip:8080
* Restart prometheus
* Hit endpoints and see data scrape by prometheus
### Backup in Jenkins
* Install Thin Backup plugin
* Create directory jenkinsbackupand cd into it.
* Set write permission to directory
